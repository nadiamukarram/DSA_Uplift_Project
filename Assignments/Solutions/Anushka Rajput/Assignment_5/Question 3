/*  Question 3: The intersection of two arrays contains the elements common to both the arrays. 
The intersection should not count duplicate elements.
Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes N and M respectively. Find their intersection
Input: 
N = 4, arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}  
M = 5, arr2 [] = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
