Given an array arr[] of integers, find the first repeating element in it. We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest

I/P:
5 10 40 4 6 5 10

O/P:
5 (5 is the first element that repeats)

n=int(input())
array=[int(x) for x in input().split()]
freq=dict()
minidx=-1
for i in range(n):
    if array[i] in freq.keys():
        minidx=i
        break
    else:
        freq[array[i]]=1
if minidx==-1:
    print("No repeating element found.")
else:
    print("{} is the first element that repeats.".format(array[minidx]))
