Question 1

Given an array arr[] of size N, the task is to sort the array in ascending order

I/P: 
6
0 9 4 10 7 8
O/P:
0 4 7 8 9 10


Question 2

An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers
Note: Order of elements is not important here


I/P:
-2  -3 7 9 -4 2 5 

O/P:
-2 -3 –4 7 9 2 5


Question 3

Given an array, cyclically rotate the array clockwise by one

I/P:
1 2 3 4 5

O/P:
5 1 2 3 4


Question 4

Given an array arr[] of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum
Hint: Kadane’s Algorithm

I/P:
8
-2 -3 4 -1 -2 1 5 -3

O/P:
7


Question 5

Given an array arr[] of integers, find the first repeating element in it. We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest

I/P:
5 10 40 4 6 5 10

O/P:
5 (5 is the first element that repeats)
